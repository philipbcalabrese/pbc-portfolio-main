            <p>Hey there! My name is Justin Blackburn. I am a senior at DePaul University studying Information Technology with a concentration in New Media Engineering and a minor in Visual Effects. I am based in Chicago, IL; however, I'm open to relocating.</p>

            <p>While at DePaul, I have taken courses ranging from purely technical topics to artist-focused workshops. As a result, I have been fortunate to work with students from all types of backgrounds. I've worked on technical projects with computer science students and film projects with animation students. My studies have allowed me to blend technical and artistic subjects to get the best from both worlds. Lately, I have been delving into the world of Technical Direction and Pipeline Development for animation or VFX studios. I love this intersection of skills as I am constantly learning something new. </p>

            <p>I bring technical skills such as experience in Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and VEX. I have utilized these skills in object-oriented programming, application development, web development, computer networking, and database management. Lately, I've been studying Python implementation in Houdini, USD workflow, Three.js, and shaders. </p>

            <p>As for creative software, I mainly work with Houdini, Maya, and Unreal Engine. I have utilized my diverse technical and artistic knowledge through VEX and Python in Houdini and Maya respectively. One highlight of my intersection of skills was developing a custom Python tool in Maya for artists (see more on the projects page). In working as a TD for a VFX/Virtual Production film, I am building custom Gizmos and Tools with Nuke for artists. </p>

            <p> 
                Recently, two of my peers and I received a grant to conduct VFX/CG research. Working alongside the Jarvis Innovation Center at DePaul University, we are working on creating a camera rig to implement a 360-degree camera. Which, we will be looking to create camera tracking solutions that utilize the 360 camera. Additionally, we are working towards creating a pipeline system of 'delighting' footage to be incorporated with CG assets. This project is in development right now and I will post updates as they come out. One of our final goals is to submit a poster to SIGGRAPH 2025 or 2026. 
            </p>
